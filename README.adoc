== To install

Source the shell script library:

[source,sh]
----
. '/path/to/vol.sh'
----

You can then call the functions defined inside it. You can place the sourcing statement in the shell's startup profile to always have it on hand.

== Examples

For example, to copy the contents of `'/root/keystore/'` into a volume `"$VOL_KEYSTORE"`:

[source,sh]
----
dir_out '/root/keystore/' | vol_in "$VOL_KEYSTORE"
----
